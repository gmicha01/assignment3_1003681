Here is the foundation of madness. The tale of Hannibal Lecter is a grisly and dark tale, but here we actually sympathize with him. He is a boy who loves his sister very much, so much he attempts to defend her against the invading looters. He is only about 10 years old, much too young to fight off five armed men, and their violation of the boy and his sister is nothing short of monstrous.
