I enjoyed this movie very much...It was full of adventure and unpredictability...It continues the movies on the life of Hannibal Lecter, presenting what made him turn up the way he did...The actors did in my opinion an excellent job,especially Gaspard Ulliel and Li Gong...The movies is an excellent thriller, full of horror scenes, including cannibalism ones...I also like the way Lecter is portrayed here, as a determined person, with an immense desire to survive and get back towards those who destroyed his life...I couldn't find a major flaw in this movie, and all the scenes were filmed very good...I rated the movie 10/10, cause it's very hard today to find a movie like this, combination of horror and thriller, and especially as good as this one.
