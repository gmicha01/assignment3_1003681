I think it's a great movie, it's totally worth watching! fits perfectly into the series if you liked the other two you will love this, it has 2007 action and 2007 "horror" i saw this movie yesterday and i want to see it again! i honestly didn't notice that it was a low budget movie! if you would like to know how Hannibal got to be the way he was when he was old than you should watch the movie all the actors were believable and Gaspard Ulliel is the best young Hannibal they could have chosen not chosen because he looks like Anthony Hopkins but chosen because he is a great actor! if if you haven't seen the movie yet then go see it!!! i love hannibal even more now enjoy the movie
